    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Your analysis here\n",
    "  \n",
    " The analysis began with an overview of each school's performance, calculating metrics such as average math and reading scores, passing  rates for math and reading, and the overall passing rate. \n",
    " The analysis provided insights into various factors that may influence academic performance, including school spending, size, and type.\n",
    " \n",
    "-Conclusions from data.\n",
    "1. Despite popular expectations the data reflects that schools with higher budgets does not always equate to having higher passing rates for math and reading. There isn't a clear corelation that higher spending per student results in better grades. This can due to other factors such as teaching quality and student one on one time as well as other reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The average math and reading scores tend to be higher in charter schools compared to district schools. This suggests that charter schools may have more effective educational programs or resources that contribute to better academic outcomes.\n",
